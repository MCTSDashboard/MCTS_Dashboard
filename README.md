# MCTS_Dashboard

## Introduction
MCTS Dashboard is a web-based application that offers visualizations and explanations about MCTS. The visualization gives the user a comprehensive view of the tree's structure. It is also an interactive tool that allows to customize the tree's size, legends, and information displayed when placing the cursor over particular nodes. The explanations furnish elucidations on MCTS determinations based on the results of simulations. By default, it generates explanations for suggested actions, but the user can also request explanations for any other accessible moves. Additionally, it has the capability of producing counterfactual explanations for two actions. The explanations generated are intended to provide users with insights into the MCTS tree's reasoning and promote trust in its decisions. Additionally, it enables users to debug the decision-making process and evaluate the game-playing strategy.
